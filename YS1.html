    Home stores and lumberyards stock tons of 4-ft. x 4-ft. engineered wood panels.
    Sheet good is the general term for these panels, but the size is specific, based on American construction standards.
    Consisting of plywood, drywall, fiberboard, exterior sheathing and oriented strand board among others, sheet goods can 
    attach to typical residential and commercial framing that is 16 inches on center.</td></tr>

	<td>Solid wood is a catchall term to indicate that something is NOT chipboard, 
	plywood or another engineered sheet good, which would be less expensive and less durable
	Solid wood can come in the form of logs straight from the arborist or planks cut from logs. It can also refer
	to anything constructed out of solid wood that had been glued into a panel, 
	like a butcher block countertop or a piece of furniture.</td></tr>

	<td>In contrast to native American hardwoods, exotic woods come from all over the world. Two popular 
	examples are teak, with its rot resistance and rich,red-hued Cuban mahogany. Teak was the material of
	choice from the early days of American cabinetmaking.Other species like Bocote, Bubinga or Padouk are 
	extraordinarily hard and quickly dull cutting tools! Often hailing from the Southern hemisphere, these 
	woods are expensive and often contribute to devastating deforestation. While beautiful and unique, the 
	dust frequently causes eye, skin and respiratory irritation.</td></tr>
	<tr><td><h3 style="color:#FE34F8 ">Plywood<h3></tr>

	<td>A manufactured product, odd number of layers of wood are glued perpendicular to each other
	to create a stable sheet, usually 4-ft. x 8-ft. Engineered for various applications, most plywood
	is comprised of less expensive interior core materials and a more aesthetic veneer on the outside.
    The manufacturer saves money by grading the veneer faces. These panels are delineated by A, B and 
	C grades, with A being the highest quality. A 1/4-in. walnut plywood used for cabinet backs where 
	one side would never be seen might have an A veneer visible and C veneer on the hidden side.
	The highest quality plywood has more internal layers and is less prone to warping.</td></tr>
	<tr><td><h3 style="color:#FE34F8 ">Medium Density Fiberboard<h3></tr>
    <tr><td><img src="https://www.familyhandyman.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-1301568237-ADeditv2.jpg?resize=768,512" width="200" height="200"></td>
	<td>Medium density fiberboard (MDF) is a smooth, rigid material perfect for finished surfaces because
	it doesnt swell or shrink with seasonal humidity.Made from a slurry of fine sawdust, adhesive and
	water, MDF panels are uniform throughout their thickness and true to size. Three-quarter MDF is indeed
	3/4-in. thick. The smooth surface is perfect for painting and structural when glued. However, MDF nicks
	easily. Nails and screws tend to split the edges, and the panels swells when they get wet.
    Because the edges are easily damaged, MDF is usually sold oversize by one inch so the rough
	edges may be cut down after purchase. LDF (light density fiberboard) is a less common lightweight alternative.</td></tr>
